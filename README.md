# FODMAP Guide

Simple Android app showing which foods (ingredients) are suitable for 
someone trying to avoid FODMAP carbs. The list is provided as-is and 
absolutely NO guarantee is given about its accuracy!! This is not meant 
to be used as medical advice.

The app itself is actually meant to be a generic template that can be 
used to display any lists of this kind. Any special diet can easily be 
imported to the app by configuring the included data.json file. The app 
reads the data file and displays whatever is inside in the GUI.
